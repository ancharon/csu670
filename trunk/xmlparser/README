To use the XML parser, navigate to the folder containing parser.py and run it
using the command "python main.py". The file expects to receive input from
stdin, and writes human-readable output to stdout. Because of this, it may be
convenient to pipe a text file to the script using something like this:
'cat rooms1.xml | python main.py'

The parser now can also accept command line arguments for testing purposes.
The command "python main.py rooms1.xml" will validate rooms1.xml against
relaxng.rng, parse its data, and print a human-readable form to stdout.

The parser uses jing for validation against the provided RELAX NG schema, so
it is important that "jing.jar" be located in the same folder. In order to
validate using jing, it creates a file called "temp.xml". The specification 
is also expected to be in that folder and be named "relaxng.rng".
