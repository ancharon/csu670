To use the XML parser, navigate to the folder containing parser.py and run it
using the command "python parser.py". The file expects to receive input from
stdin, and writes human-readable output to stdout.

The parser uses jing for validation against the provided RELAX NG schema, so
it is important that "jing.jar" be located in the same folder. In order to
validate using jing, it creates a file called "temp.xml". The specification 
is also expected to be in that folder and be named "relaxng.rng".
